## Tools and Frameworks

- React.js Front End with Typescript

  - The top tier of the MERN stack is React.js, the declarative JavaScript framework for creating dynamic client-side applications in HTML. React lets you build up complex interfaces through simple Components, connect them to data on your backend server, and render them as HTML.

  - React’s strong suit is handling stateful, data-driven interfaces with minimal code and minimal pain, and it has all the bells and whistles you’d expect from a modern web framework: great support for forms, error handling, events, lists, and more.

- Cypress Front End Testing
  - Cypress is the new standard in front-end testing that every developer and QA engineer needs. programmer. Developer-friendly.
